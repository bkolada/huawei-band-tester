# huawei-band-tester
A script to perform tests against different bands to find out which network and band has best results for current router setup. 

# Purpose and strategy 

I encounter that default configuration of my HUAWEI router is far from being perfect. I found https://github.com/littlejo/huawei-lte-examples which is really good piece of script and I was able to test different configurations of bands. Now I would like to automate entire process of finding best configuration.


# Milestones 
- read/update information on huawei router 
- performing tests with different bands on different networks 
- download csv with results of the test
- adding dl/up link speed to tests
- setting up best configuration
